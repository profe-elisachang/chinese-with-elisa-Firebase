Every morning she goes shopping for vegetables at a quarter to eight, and then visits the food shop to buy some meat and fish. At half past ten in the morning she goes to church. After returning home, she begins preparing lunch, which is ready in less than half an hour. I especially love eating her fish-flavored pork strips and noodles.

<span class="english-text">My friend's older brother and his wife work in Japan and haven't returned to China for a long time. In Japan, they miss their motherland and family very much. One year when they returned home, everyone asked them: "How is life in Japan?" After thinking for a moment, they said: "China is still the best!" His older brother also loves literature and speaks Japanese well. He often tells the children: "If you want to learn a foreign language well, you must listen more, speak more, write more, and read aloud more." I think what he said makes a lot of sense.</span>
